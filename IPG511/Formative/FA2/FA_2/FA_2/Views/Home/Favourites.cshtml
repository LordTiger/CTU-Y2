                    A new TV series based on Watchmen will debut on HBO in 2019 by the creator of Lost, Damon Lindelof
                    A murder mystery-turned-nationwide conspiracy, Watchmen examines the lives of the eponymous superhero team as they seem to decay alongside the ever-darkening America around them. Rorschach, Nite Owl, the Silk Spectre,
                    Dr. Manhattan and Ozymandias reunite to investigate who’s behind a teammate’s murder,
                    but find that the truth may be even more grim than the world they seek to protect.
